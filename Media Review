#This program is meant to be a sort of database for books and media I consume, in it I will be able to input titles, a numerical review of the media, a written review and the media's genre. This information will be saved and will then be able to be pulled up later.
#This project is inspired by the website https://www.whatshouldireadnext.com/ and by my own habit of writing lists for pretty much everything that I do.
